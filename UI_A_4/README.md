# iPhone 12 iOS 14 Clone
This project is a simple representation of a iPhone 12 clone built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It mimics the design and layout of the iPhone 12 interface to showcase how these technologies can be used to create responsive and interactive web interfaces.

## Features

<li>iOS notifications added</li>

<li>Pressing any part of the appScreen (that is not an app) will go directly to the home screen edition</li>
